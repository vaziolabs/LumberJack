![lumberjack500](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f1c2f9e-a550-47eb-8f18-a11abbc1cf58)
## Overview
The LumberJack API provides a hierarchical event tracking system where nodes can have multiple parents and events can be tracked across different organizational paths.

## Installation & Usage

### Using as a Package
```bash
go get github.com/vaziolabs/lumberjack
```

### Building from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaziolabs/lumberjack.git
cd lumberjack
go build
```

### Getting Started
Starting LumberJack is as simple as running the following command:
```bash
./lumberjack
```

To create a new server configuration:
```bash

## Core Concepts

### Nodes
- **Branch Node**: Can contain other nodes
- **Leaf Node**: End points for tracking events
- Each node can have multiple parents, enabling flexible organizational structures

### Events
An Event represents a tracked activity with start/end times and associated entries.

#### Attributes:
- `StartTime`: When the event begins
- `EndTime`: When the event concludes
- `Entries`: List of timestamped records
- `Metadata`: Custom event data
- `Status`: pending/ongoing/finished

### Entries
Timestamped records within an event.

#### Attributes:
- `Timestamp`: Creation time
- `Content`: Entry data
- `Metadata`: Additional entry info
- `UserID`: Creator identifier

## Response Formats

### Event Summary Response
```json
{
  "event_id": "sprint-1",
  "status": "finished",
  "start_time": "2024-01-01T09:00:00Z",
  "end_time": "2024-01-14T17:00:00Z",
  "entries_count": 15,
  "metadata": {
    "type": "sprint",
    "team": "alpha"
  }
}
```

### Time Tracking Summary Response
```json
[
  {
    "start_time": "2024-01-04T09:00:00Z",
    "end_time": "2024-01-04T17:00:00Z",
